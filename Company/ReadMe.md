# Observation

We have companies in 1,2,3 sectors of the local and global economy. The companies to individual or group of person need a contract to start a new company. 
This agreement is replaced by the Smart Contracts. Smart contract for businesses has a structure similar to the centralized system of business and people data for state control rights and obligations.
The Smart Contract must predict all variables that can cause conflict between the parties and solve the problem without intermediaries, without a few seconds. 
Then, is necessary follow the Legal Plan to each companies. In this phase we analysis the follow elements:
